# My App

This project is a full-stack web application for searching and viewing stock information. The frontend is built with Next.js and TypeScript, while the backend is developed using ASP.NET Core.

## What I Have Done

- Designed and implemented a modern frontend using Next.js and React, with TypeScript for type safety.
- Built custom React components for searching stocks, displaying stock details, and managing the user interface.
- Developed a RESTful API in ASP.NET Core to handle stock data requests and serve data to the frontend.
- Connected the frontend and backend so users can search for stocks and view details in real time.
- Organized the project structure for clarity and scalability, separating frontend, backend, components, and static assets.

## Project Structure

- `app/` - Next.js frontend application
- `components/` - Custom React components (e.g., StockSearch, StockList, StockDetail)
- `backend/backend/` - ASP.NET Core backend API
- `public/` - Static assets (images, icons, etc.)

## How to Run
